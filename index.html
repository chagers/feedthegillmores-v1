                <div class="ingredients">- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/4 pounds)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Salt to taste if desired
- Freshly ground pepper to taste
- 1 zucchini, about 1/2 pound, ends trimmed
- 2 teaspoons curry powder
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 2 tablespoons finely chopped shallots

2. Trim off the ends of the zucchini and cut it into 12 rounds, each about 1/2-inch thick. Add zucchini and curry powder to the chicken and blend well with the fingers to coat the pieces evenly.
 
3. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil in a heavy skillet and add the chicken pieces in one layer. Scatter the zucchini rounds between the chicken pieces, preferably in one layer. Cook over moderately high heat until chicken pieces are nicely browned on one side, about 3 minutes. Turn the chicken pieces and the zucchini rounds and cook over moderately low heat about 5 minutes.
 
4. Transfer chicken pieces and zucchini rounds to a warm serving dish.
 
5. Pour off the fat from the skillet and add the butter. Add shallots and cook, stirring, about 30 seconds. Add broth and cook until reduced to about 1/3 cup. Add cream, stir and bring to a boil.

                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <div class="ingredients">- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 medium onion, chopped
- 2 medium carrots, peeled and chopped
- 1 celery stalk, chopped
- Salt
- 4 large garlic cloves, minced or pressed
- 1 pound tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped, or 1 (14-ounce) can chopped tomatoes, with liquid
- 1 medium turnip, peeled and diced
- ¾ pound zucchini, diced
- A bouquet garni consisting of 1 Parmesan rind, 1 bay leaf, 3 sprigs parsley and 3 sprigs thyme, tied together with kitchen string or tied into a piece of cheesecloth
- 1 (15-ounce) can cannellini or borlotti beans, drained and rinsed
- 6 ounces green beans, cut into 1-inch lengths
- ½ cup soup pasta, such as elbow macaroni, or broken spaghetti, or 3/4 cup penne
- Freshly ground pepper to taste
- ¼ cup slivered fresh basil leaves, or 1/2 cup pistou (recipe follows)
- Freshly grated Parmesan for garnish</div>
                <h3>Preparation</h3>
                <div class="preparation">1. Heat the olive oil over medium-low heat in a large, heavy soup pot or Dutch oven and add the onion, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring, until beginning to soften, about 3 minutes, and add 1/2 teaspoon salt. Continue to cook, stirring often, until tender, about 5 more minutes. Add the garlic, stir together for about a minute, and stir in the tomatoes. Cook, stirring, until the tomatoes have cooked down and smell fragrant, about 10 minutes. Stir in 2 quarts water, the turnip, zucchini, and the bouquet garni, and bring to a simmer. Add 2 teaspoons salt, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer 45 minutes. Stir in the canned beans. Taste and adjust salt. Remove the bouquet garni.

2. While the soup is simmering, bring a pot of salted water to a boil and add the green beans. Boil 5 minutes, until just tender but still bright green. Transfer to a bowl of ice water, allow to cool, and drain. Retain the cooking water in case you want to thin out the soup later. 

3. Add the pasta to the soup and simmer another 10 minutes, or until the pasta is cooked al dente. Stir the cooked green beans into the soup. Grind in some pepper and taste and adjust seasonings. It should be savory and rich-tasting. 

4. Stir in the basil or pistou, or place a spoonful of pistou in each bowl and stir in. Serve in wide soup bowls, with a sprinkling of Parmesan over the top.</div>

                <div class="ingredients">- 1 pound large shrimp, peeled and deveined
-  Salt to taste
- ⅛ teaspoon sugar (leave out for diet friendly!)
- 2 tablespoons canola oil or light sesame oil
- 1 tablespoon minced ginger
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- ¼ to ½ teaspoon crumbled dried red chili
- 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
- 1 generous bunch spinach (about 1 pound), stems trimmed at the end, rinsed in 2 changes water

                <h3>Preparation</h3>
                <div class="preparation">1. Place the shrimp in a large colander and rinse with water. Sprinkle generously with salt and toss together for about a minute. Rinse with water and repeat. After rinsing one more time, drain on paper towels. Pat dry with more paper towels.

2. Combine 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon salt (to taste) and the sugar in a small bowl and place close to your wok.

3. Heat a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok over high heat until a drop of water evaporates within a second or two when added to the pan. Swirl in 1 tablespoon of the oil by adding it to the sides of the pan and swirling the pan, then add the garlic, ginger and chili flakes and stir-fry for no more than 10 seconds. Push to the sides of the pan and add the shrimp in one layer. Let cook undisturbed for 1 minute, then add the remaining oil and stir-fry for 1 minute.

4. Add the sesame seeds and spinach and stir-fry for 1 minute, until it has begun to wilt but the wilting is still uneven. Add the salt and sugar, sprinkling it evenly over the spinach, and continue to stir-fry until the spinach has wilted but is still bright and the shrimp are cooked through and bright pink, about 2 more minutes. Remove from the heat, drizzle on the sesame oil, toss together and serve, with rice, noodles or other grains.

- Advance preparation: You can prepare the shrimp through Step 1 several hours ahead.
